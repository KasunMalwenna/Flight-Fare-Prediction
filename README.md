# Flight Fare Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the capstone project undertaken at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/) Data Science Bootcamp. The deployment phase as a web apllication be accessed at [Flight-Fare-Prediction-Web-App](https://github.com/KasunMalwenna/Flight-Fare-Prediction.git) repository.

## Problem Statement
Fueled by inflation and due to limitations caused by the recent pandemic air ticket prices have skyrocketed over the last couple of years, rendering many airlines unprofitable and insolvent. This in turn has resulted in major travel disruptions while causing 2.3 million job depreciation.
Can Machine Learning and Deep learning techniques be employed to accurately predict the volatile air ticket prices such that airline companies can adjust their pricing strategies to increase revenue and remain competitive during this stagflation?
